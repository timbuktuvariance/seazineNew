# About Seazine

SeaZINE is a platform to share fascinating stories, ideas and visuals about sea life and people. I hope to inspire and move myself and others to take action to help protect and restore our seas and coastal areas.

## About me

I am a marine scientist and environmental communicator. I work with communities and organisations to bring about positive changes to our lives and natural environment. Through training, participatory projects and communications with a touch of art...revisit!

I’m also a printmaker and a water baby – give me a shout if you fancy a dip in the Tay! I am based in Dundee, Scotland. More professional stuff on my LinkedIn and my opinions and news on Twitter.
